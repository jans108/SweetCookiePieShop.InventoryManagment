I undertook a solo project to develop a console application using
C# and the .NET framework, showcasing a comprehensive understanding and practical application of C# language
features. The project served as a testament to my proficiency in
fundamental concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, error handling, unit testing, LINQ
queries (leveraging method extension), and the utilization of
interfaces.
